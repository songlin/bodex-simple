# Dex3-1 Right Hand Pose Transfer
# Hand coordinate frame:
#   X: along fingers (pointing forward)
#   Y: towards thumb-side / palm normal (pointing left hand direction)
#   Z: normal to thumb-index plane (pointing upwards)
#
# This matches standard robot convention, so identity transform is used

  r: [[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]  # Identity (already aligned)
  t: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # No translation offset needed
